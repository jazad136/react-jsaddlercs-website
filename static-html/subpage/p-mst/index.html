<div class="writeup">
    <p>We used Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Finder algorithm to see applications of dynamic programming in an area other than strict sequences of units. Before addressing Prim's, we covered other supporting methods of graph search such as highly related Breadth First Search, whose methods of selecting nodes from the top down helped us understand Prim's. Algorithms like Prim's take a set of units and basic relationships between them, and output a new network of relationships. This algorithm takes relations that have a weight, and outputs a set of relations that meet the criteria of a tree-graph[1] with a minimum weight.</p>
    
    <p>Rather than go over a strict algorithm that involved implementation details beyond the scope of what the course could cover, we set out to identify the patterns of choice that make Prim's algorithm work at each level of the algorithm. Some of the images shown below help highlight parts of live demonstrations provided in-class, where we used a "magnifying glass" approach. Prim's makes "local" choices, choices based on information it knows about only part of the solution, to incrementally build a tree that it can output.

	<p>Before going over this algorithm of building trees, we explored the meaning behind the units used in said algorithms, by covering the &quot;node&quot; and the concept of &quot;relations&quot; which control when relationships are shown between them. </p>

	<p>Students were guided through the workmanship of Prim's algorithm using multiple examples. One example did not involve a visible graph, and instead used progress tables to track progression, where we could track together instances of making greedy local choices at each step.</p>
	<p>To support those who might be helped, the assignment itself included graphical examples to go along with it. Time available in the semester reduced our ability to review together each important concept of graph algorithms like Prim's, as these came later in the course, so assignments held the brunt of instruction for this part of the course.</p>
