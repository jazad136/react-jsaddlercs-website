    <h4>SENG 5005 - Fall 2020</h4>

  <div class="writeup">
    <p>I was fortunate to teach the first 4 week segment of SENG 5005 Fall 2020, a course designed to introduce graduate students to discrete structures as they transitioned into the computer science program on their path to complete ECU Computer Science graduate degree programs.</p>
    <p>SENG 5005 is designed as a &quot;bridge&quot; course designed to combine many topics into one. In my teaching of this course we covered some of the following.</p>

  <div id="samples" class="container">
    <dl class="row">
      <dt class="col-sm-5">
	<h3 class="title">Boolean Logic Foundations</h3>
	<p>Truth tables and matters of discovering validity were constructed by combining variables of propositions through various means. </p>

      <dt class="col-sm-5">
	<h3 class="title">Properties of Finite/Infinite Sets</h3>
      <p>Collections of numbers were demonstrated to have properties of their own when combined through well set operations such as Cartesian product, union and intersection.</p></dt>
      
      <dd class="col-sm-7"><img src="../../images/ds-images/SnapDS_Sets.png"/></dd>
      <dt class="col-sm-5">
	<h3 class="title">Operations on Sets</h3>
	<p>Students were given practical examples of groups of operations used to construct new sets, such as via Cartesian product, union and intersection. Later they worked through examples that showed and asked for how to reason about equivalence of known set identities via both written proof or membership tables.</p></dt>

    <dt class="col-sm-5">
      <h3 class="title">Proof Techniques</h3>
      <p>Students studied examples of deducing truth based on mathematical axioms and worked-out, logical equivalences demonstrated in class based on these. Proof by contradiction, contrapositive, and direct proposition were covered in the first four weeks.</p>
